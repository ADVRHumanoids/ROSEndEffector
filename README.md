# ROS End-Effector 
It provides a ROS-based set of standard interfaces to command robotics end-effectors in an agnostic fashion.

The ROS End-Effector main documentation is here: https://advrhumanoids.github.io/ROSEndEffectorDocs/

Doxygen-generated documentation about the API of ROS End-Effector can be found here: https://advrhumanoids.github.io/ROSEndEffector/index.html

## NOTES about XBOT2 usage
- Check robotiq2f srdf for correctess. Each link/joint must belong to a chain, even the virtual link/joint
- In urdf, add the xbot plugin. Again check the robotiq2f, each non fixed joint must have a PID ! even the mimic. put 0 gains for mimics. And keep the mimic joint plugin, maybe in future will be integrated in xbot
- rosee.world has the clock plugin added. This is already done, the world is used by each hand

- Running:
  - 1 terminal roscore (maybe not necessary)
  - 2 terminal: source xbot, source rosee, set_xbot2_config (necessary?), and launch rosee_gazebo_plugin (or rosee_startup) file with hand name. RUN gazebo
  - 3 terminal: set_xbot2_config, export xbot_root, and finally xbot2-core --verbose
  - 4 terminal: rosservice call /xbotcore/ros_ctrl/switch 1  otherwise command through ros are not read, then you can call the gui to move the hand
  
  - other stuff:
    - To publish via topic, the field ctrl_mode must be set (to 1 for position?)
    - If command is too brute, xbot stops the joint device by default, to restore: rosservice call /xbotcore/joint_master/set_control_mask 1
    
*TODO*
- Check all other hands
- Test the whole ROSEE + XBOT2 + Gazebo, automatize launch files if necessary
- A method to choose between xbot joint server and rosee plugin in the urdf
