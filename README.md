Welcome to the ROS End-Effector Action finder 

# How to run for the Schunk Hand
```bash
#usual source
roslaunch ros_end_effector findActionsSchunk.launch
```
Note that urdf and srdf files for schunk are in the urdf and srdf folders of this branch.    
2 yaml files will be created/ovewritten in /configs/actions/<hand_name>
### To play with the hand and manually set the poses
##### Install schunk things: 
(following [here](http://wiki.ros.org/schunk_svh_driver), section "2.4 From Source")
```bash
mkdir ~/schunk_ws
mkdir ~/schunk_ws/src
cd ~/schunk_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/fzi_icl_core.git #schunk library, not sure if needed for only simulation
git clone https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/fzi_icl_comm.git #schunk library, not sure if needed for only simulation
git clone https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/schunk_svh_driver.git #the main schunk repo
cd ..
catkin_make_isolated
source devel_isolated/setup.bash
```
#### Finally launch the hand simulation
```bash
roslaunch schunk_svh_driver svh_controller.launch standalone:=true gui:=true simulation:=true
```
Be sure to put in rviz as fixed frame __base_link__

# How to run for the TestEE Example
```bash
#usual source
roslaunch ros_end_effector findActionsTestEE.launch
```
#### To play with the hand and manually set the poses
```bash
roslaunch ros_end_effector two_finger_ee_startup.launch inSlider:=true
```

# How to run for the 2 Finger example
```bash
#usual source
roslaunch ros_end_effector findActionsTwoFinger.launch
```
#### To play with the hand and manually set the poses
```bash
roslaunch ros_end_effector test_ee_startup.launch inSlider:=true
```
