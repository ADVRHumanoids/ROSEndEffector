Possible Issues
========================

- From 28-01-2020 the *use_gui* param (in launch files) gives an error because it is deprecated. This causes the sliders of joint state publisher not shown. To solve : 

  .. code-block:: console
  
    sudo apt install ros-kinetic-joint-state-publisher-gui
    
  **NOTE** *use_gui* is not used anymore by us, but this answer can be useful anyway

- With the schunk hand, if we move only the middle finger (base phalange)
  toward the hand, a collision between index tip, middle tip and ring tip is detected. 
  Easy reproducible with the `moveit assistant <http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html>`_, in the set pose section (when we move the middle finger it finds a collision when visually is not present)
  I dont know if it is a problem of schunk model, moveit, or both.
